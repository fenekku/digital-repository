## User Stats Explained

#### Prepared for @kglibrarian

1. Your Statistics - from the `/dashboard` view, the panel on the left, below the “Upload” button. 
  - __Files you’ve deposited__ - This is the number of current uploaded files by you, the user. If a file that you uploaded has been deleted, this number will adjust. You can click on this number, and view all the files that you have uploaded and are current on the site. It will not display deleted files.
    - `Views` - This is the sum of all of your uploaded files page views, including deleted. If a deleted file that you uploaded previously had page views, this number will not subtract the deleted files' page views. This number is updated weekly. 
    -  `Downloads` - This is the sum of all of your uploaded files downloads, including deleted. If a deleted file that you uploaded previously had downloads, this number will not subtract the deleted files' downloads. This number is updated weekly. 
  - __Collections you’ve created__ - this is the number of current created collections by you, the user. If a collection that you created has been deleted, this number will adjust. You can click on this number and view all the current collections created by you. It will not display deleted collections. 
  - __People you follow__ - Sum of all the users that you are following. You can click on this number to view a list of the users you are following.
  - __People who are following you__ - Sum of all the users that are following you. You can click on this number to view a list of the users following you. 
  - __Collections you follow(coming soon! [*](#issue572 "Issue #572") )__ - Sum of all the collections that you are following. You can click on this number to view a list of collections you follow. 
  - *Related Note* - Excluding `Views` and `Downloads`, most activity regarding these statistics will appear in User Activity and User Notifications panels. For example, when a user starts following you, or when a new file has been uploaded by a user you follow, the activity will be logged. 

2. Analytics - from an individual file view, under Actions, on the left side of the page. This information is tracked by google analytics. 
  - The Analytics, `/stats` view page, displays a graph information of a file’s page views and downloads. It begins the day the file is uploaded. This information is updated weekly. 
    - `Views/Page views` - Defined by google analytics, “a view of a page”. Full explanation found [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1257084?hl=en#pageviews_vs_unique_views).
    - `Downloads` - Tracked by google analytics when the “Download” link has been clicked. Each time this event occurs, google will store this information. If one user during one session clicks on the “Download” link *n* number of times, google analytics will count each *n* click. 
  - Page views information is saved by google analytics on both files and collections. Downloads information is also saved by google analytics, but only on files. Only files information is currently available to display on DigitalHub. If a user wants the page views information for a collection, a request will need to be made.
